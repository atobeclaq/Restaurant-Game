# Restaurant Game

Welcome to the Restaurant Game project! This is a restaurant game where players can immerse themselves in the world of running a restaurant. Get ready to prepare dishes and serve customers to build a successful establishment!

## How to Play

- Click on the preparation area to start preparing dishes.
- Access the Menu by clicking on the Menu book.
- Increase the stock of dishes by clicking on their respective pictures in the Menu book.
- Be mindful of the green energy bar, as each action will consume energy. The bar will gradually replenish over time.

## Customer Interaction

- Customers will randomly enter the restaurant as long as there are empty seats available.
- Customers will place orders, and if the ordered dish is in stock, their satisfaction and intimacy with the restaurant will increase.

## Progression and Rewards

- As the restaurant serves more customers, it will gain experience and level up.
- Leveling up unlocks new dishes and furniture options (currently under development).

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository using Git:

```git clone https://github.com/atobeclaq/Restaurant-Game.git```


## Usage

The game can be easily launched using the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) Golive extension.

## Features

- Dynamic gameplay with the potential to introduce more customers and dishes as the restaurant levels up.
- Room for future expansion and customization of the game.

Happy gaming!
